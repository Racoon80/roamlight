//  Where the token lives.

//  ⚠ The keychain and NOT `UserDefaults`: a token that stays valid until it is
//    revoked does not belong in a file that comes along in every backup and
//    every device migration. `ThisDeviceOnly` means it does NOT travel to a new
//    phone -- there you scan again, and that is right, because the list on the
//    site is kept per device.
